## Review notes
- In the interest of time, I got a little lazy with the styling ðŸ˜…, I didn't want to spend a ton of time getting everything perfect.
- I did what I could to fetch data I needed with the APIs provided, there are certainly better ways of handling data fetching in some places, but that would require changes in the APIs or new endpoints.
- I tooks some creative liberties for the UX, I wasn't quite sure about specifics you had in mind for this.
