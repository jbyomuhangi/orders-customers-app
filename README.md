## Getting Started

### Note: Please make sure you are using some v20 version of node (preferably the latest LTS version).

First, install the dependancies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```


Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Review notes
- In the interest of time, I got a little lazy with the styling ðŸ˜…, I didn't want to spend a ton of time getting everything perfect.
- I did what I could to fetch data I needed with the APIs provided, there are certainly better ways of handling data fetching in some places, but that would require changes in the APIs or new endpoints.
- I tooks some creative liberties for the UX, I wasn't quite sure about specifics you had in mind for this.
